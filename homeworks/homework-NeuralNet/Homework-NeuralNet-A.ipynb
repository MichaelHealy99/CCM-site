The “database” for this exercise is the Jets and Sharks data base shown in Figure 1, which has the central characters from the two gangs. You are to use the IAC model in conjunction with this data base to run illustrative simulations of these basic properties of memory.\n",

As the properties of Ken connected by his hidden layer are activated going forward in a cycle, it will also at least minorly activate the hidden nodes of gang members who share most of his characteristics, whereas others who have fewer simularities have their activation stiffled by the negative activation of their dissimilar characteristics."

    "Whereas before the visible name node had a direct connection to the hidden node probably with an extremely large weight since they are directly correlated, activating specific property nodes does not strongly control the activation or inhibition of other properties and leaves them to be activated by back-propagation. Beforehand the Nick and Neal nodes were also being activated do to their similarities, and the characteristics they didn't share with Ken inhibited the signal of those properties. \"Age\" was one of them, but 'in20s' already has a max activation for that property, so the other dissimilar property- \"Occupation\"- shows that as the network is cycled through, the occupation nodes of those similar to Ken are activated, which then cause those similar to Nick and Neal to activate slightly and excite the signal on further cycles, inhibiting Ken's true occupation as a 'Burglar' slightly."
